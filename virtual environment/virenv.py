"""to make a virtual environment we first have to install
a package called virtualenv
then to make the virtual environment just type virtualenv environmentname in the terminal
command to activate virtual environment in the terminal .\environmentname\Scripts\activate
and to close a open virtual environment just type deactivate in terminal
pip freeze to get info about installed packages
to get all your packages in a single file just use pip freeze > requirements.txt run pip freeze before it
then to install packages form that requirements five we do pip install -r .\requirements.txt
now for git bash the commands to activate a virtual environment are source .venv/Scripts/activate
but before using this command you have to use cd filepath to open the file where you can get filepath by locating file in file explorer"""
